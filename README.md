# Motivation

Read from multiple slaves and write to single master while working with sql database cluster.
Inspired by http://github.com/tsenart/nap

## Install
```shell
$ go get github.com/datalinkE/sqlxentrypoint
```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
  "log"

  "github.com/datalinkE/sqlx-entrypoint"
  _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // Any sql.DB works
)

func main() {
  // The first DSN is assumed to be the master and all
  // other to be slaves
  dsns := "tcp://user:password@master/dbname;"
  dsns += "tcp://user:password@slave01/dbname;"
  dsns += "tcp://user:password@slave02/dbname"

  db, err := sqlx-entrypoint.Open("mysql", dsns)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  if err := db.Ping(); err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Some physical database is unreachable: %s", err)
  }

  // Read queries are directed to slaves with Query and QueryRow.
  // Load distribution is round-robin.
  var count int
  err = db.Slave().QueryRow("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sometable").Scan(&count)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  // Write queries are directed to the master with Exec.
  err = db.Master().Exec("UPDATE sometable SET something = 1")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  // Transactions always use the master
  tx, err := db.Master().Begin()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  // Do something transactional ...
  if err = tx.Commit(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

}
```

## Todo
* Support other slave load balancing algorithms.
